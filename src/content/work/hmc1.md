I worked with a brilliant team in the HMC Bee Lab on an ongoing project to monitor honey bee hive health. The project involves taking overhead drone images of the Robert Redford Conservancy and processing them using machine learning. This would be used to automate identification of floral density and diversity, indicators of honey bee hive health. This included assessing model performance, developing tools, and setting up a new workstation to be used.
