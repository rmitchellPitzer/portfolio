While at Pitzer and Harvey Mudd College I had the opportunity to tutor students in Computer Science courses. This included Principles of Computer Science, Intro to Computer Science, and Computing Practices/Projects/People. I immensely enjoyed my team teaching others as I could see students become more and more passionate for computing and CS. I taught students a variety of topics including Java, Python, and mentoring students in completing a final project.
