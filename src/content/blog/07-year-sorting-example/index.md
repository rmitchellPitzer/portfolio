### ðŸ’¬ Coming soon! Currently being written!


Each year Harvey Mudd College runs a clinic program. This is done for students within the Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics department. Students will be surveyed with a list of projects and companies they would like to work on, and throughout their senior year will work in a team to solve the problem. Students get valuable work experience in the form of a capstone project, companies are able to solve problems they do not have additional resources to throw at, and HMC is able to afford to pay their tutors using funding. 

When I learned what clinic team I had been assigned to, it was through a spreadsheet showing each team member's name, what school they attended, and their major. The list was mostly full of HMC and CMC students, with only one other Pitzer student. If we consider that my graduating class is representative of the student body, there is a total of 8 cs majors at Pitzer College.

Depending on the year, there are roughly 1,200 students attending Pitzer College. It can feel bonkers that a major so in demand only makes up 2/3'rds a percentage of Pitzer's student population. Surely Pitzer students aren't all staunchly opposed to computation and Computer Science, so why is this the case?

### Computer Science as an Off Campus Student

One of the draws of attending Pitzer College for myself was a liberal arts education. I knew I am incredibly passionate about environmentalism, and at the time I felt Pitzer would be a great place to major in Biology. A bennefit of a liberal arts education is actually finding out you dislike the major you intended to lock in for the rest of your life, and instead switch to a class you happened to take and really enjoy. Principles of Computer Science with Professor Breeden was this class for me. 

Another draw of the Claremont Colleges was it's small student population and consortium status. Students could take classes with an astoundingly small student to professor ratio, and due to the consortium status students can take classes with experts in their field. For instance, if a Scripps student is interested in environmental science they can take EA classes at Pitzer. A Pomona student might be interested in Economics and CMC would have the classes up their alley. A Pitzer student might be interested in Computer Science and Harvey Mudd College is one of the best undergraduate schools for that.

Except, that none of that is really true anymore, at least for Computer Science. There is an incredible increase of students wanting to take CS courses and major in CS each year. Both Harvey Mudd College and Pomona College are feeling the effects of this, and each has taken steps to reduce the number of CS majors.

When I had declared my major in Computer Science, there was already a "lottery system" in place to limit CS majors. Harvey Mudd College requires all first years to take intro to Computer Science, and while it's possible to register for it as an off campus student, after the 300+ students register for it it can be difficult to place into it. So most students would either take Intro to CS in the Spring, or they would take Intro to CS at Pitzer. From there, you could try and register for the next step in CS Principles of Computer Science. This class is required for CS majors, so any CS major declared at Mudd would be able to take it. There were not many spots left for off campus students once registration was complete. These students were decided via a lottery system. The off campus students who made it in could then declare their major in Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College.

I made it in that year in what is one of the luckiest moments of my life. However, after that year it became much more difficult. Pitzer stopped teaching intro to CS and started teaching CS4, as in, CS4 non majors. It is virtually identical to CS5, except taking it virtually disqualifies you from CS60. Now you would need to miraculously place into CS5 at Mudd now, then place into CS60 the next semester. If you're out of luck on any of these steps it could be a year before you're able to try again. 

I also mentioned that Pomona College is navigating the same problems Harvey Mudd College is, and they've solved it by closing the CS major to all off campus students.

### Academia vs. Industry

So the problem seems to be: Harvey Mudd College does not have enough professors to teach CS. Let's just hire more CS professors then! 

Except, there's a shortage of CS professors. It can be difficult and takes time to hire good faculty for tenure-track positions. At the same time the number of CS students is growing faster than can be kept up wtih. At the same time, nearly all CS majors go into industry instead of academia. CS majors who go into academia can expect two to four more years of a masters degree, four+ years for a PhD, and maybe being hired at a university then taking six more years for a tenure track, then finally over 10 years after graduating with a bachelors, be hired on as a professor. That, or they can be hired in the industry immediately upon graduating and make a comparable total compensation. Of course there are many reasons to go into academia, and I myself hope to one day, but it is telling that one of my own CS professors has at some point considered leaving their tenured position to work at big tech, and that one of their students immediately upon graduation makes more than they do. 

### CMC Has Money Money

One of the ideas communicated to me during discussions at the 5C's was "nobody has the capability to invest more resources into CS, except Claremont McKenna". To an extent, that is true. Pitzer, Scripps, and HMC all have significantly smaller endowments than Pomona and Claremont McKenna. Pitzer and Scripps definitely do not have the resources, budget, or endowment to invest in a CS department when that same spending can go towards departments that need funding. HMC is already funding their CS department and hiring CS professors. I do have a lack of knowledge on Pomona College, but I would believe their broad focus and lack of specialization in majors means much less of it's annual budget is available to their CS department than Mudd's is.

CMC definitely has the resources to invest in CS. Currently the Robert Day Sciences Senter is under construction, and CMC has created a Data Science department which takes an enormous amount of money, time, and effort, which is great for students and faculty. Students at any of the 5C's who want to take Data Science courses can do so at CMC. Many of the students I tutored for CS4 ended up doing Data Science at CMC, as they could not get into CS at Mudd. 

However, Data Science is not CS. You might remember earlier when I mentioned that most of the students in the clinic sheet were either CMC students or HMC students. Of course, take this with a grain of salt, but it is rumored that there are agreements between the 5C's for exchanges of students for certain majors. CMC seems to be in a position that allows them to send more students to Mudd for CS majors.

So if CMC has CS majors covered for their students, then why invest in a brand new CS department in their school? That's time and money they could dedicate towards Data Science or other departments or a brand new building. All this is to say, CMC has us covered for Data Science, but still does not solve the problem of CS's unavailability.

### A Minoooooooorrr

There is also the existence of the CS Minor at Scripps College, which has been a recent development. I spoke to professors who worked on this to coordinate the curriculum and decide what is essential for a CS Minor. Fortunately, Scripps also has off campus students covered. Pitzer students who are unable to major in CS at Mudd can at least minor in CS at Scripps. It won't be comparable to CS at Mudd or Pomona, but it is very good that students havet his option available to them.

### Wrap It Up Already

So, where do things stand as of June 2024? 
- HMC and Pomona have a shortage of professors that can teach CS to a growing student body
- HMC and Pomona both limit off campus students in some way
- The solution to this problem lies outside of the capabilities of any one college or consortium to solve
- Pitzer and Scripps can not invest in CS more than they already have
- CMC is investing in Data Science heavily

This is somewhat benneficial to students, as there are now options for CS minors, Data Science Majors, and if students luck out, a CS major at Mudd. As much as I love CS, I think the bigger bennefit is giving the wide variety of students who all want different things from their education options.

I do not think my solution to this problem is unique, but I would like to see more inter-college exchange demonstrated. You might have remembered how CMC is able to send more students to Mudd in some exchange. I think the solution to CS's growing demand lies not in increasing resources for CS, but for adding computation to already existing curriculum and departments. Someone who is interested in EA might not be interested in Discrete at Mudd, but they might be interested in an EA course that uses R or Javascript to create dashboards focused on environmental impacts. Someone who is interested in Econ might not want to take electives in CS, but they might be interested in quant topics in their own courses. The desire for a CS major isn't solely because of the CS major, but because of computation. Each college specializes in different areas that make them desirable and unique, and if computation is injected into each of these specialties, students will bennefit as much as professors do from a more modern, future proof curriculum. When this happens, these colleges might have more room to exchange students. A student at Mudd might not want to major in CS, but might be interested in art and cs at Pitzer. A student at Pitzer might not be interested in EA, but might want to go to Mudd to do that. 

It does not address every problem I listed here *industry vs academia* but I think this sharing of resources will make it easier for not just off campus students, but for all students to get the education and guidance and teaching they desire.

Or who knows i could be talking out of my ass lmao.
