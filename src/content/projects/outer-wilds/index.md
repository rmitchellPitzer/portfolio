LoFi Outer Wilds to Study and Chill To was one of the first projects I made after learning React. It's also a personal project on my favorite game Outer Wilds!

If you have not played Outer Wilds (and you do not get motion sick!) I strongly encourage you to not look up anything about it and play it. Outer Wilds contains multiple instruments that can be synced together depending on the player's location and when they're synced together pieces of a song can play. Sometimes I just want to listen to the piano or the strings part of the song, but the only way to do this was to boot up the game and sync the instruments together, which can be distracting when you are getting work done.

I made LoFi Outer Wilds to Study and Chill To by recording each instrument, splitting them into equal durations, and then using Howler.JS to play them. React's UseState kept track of what instruments were playing, and what timestamp the instruments were currently at. The website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://rmitchellpitzer.github.io/LoFiOuterWildsToStudyAndChillTo/).

I then added toggles for campfire sound effects, crickets, and sounds from the surface in one of the planets in the game. I've always loved [Meli-Luminati's artwork of Outer Wilds](https://meliluminati.com/about/) and I'm grateful to her for allowing me to use her art on this project!
