ICS Specific Language was a project created during the class Domain Specific Languages. It's an application that can create ICS files, preview them, and import them to Google Calendars. This can be done by using text input in the form of a Domain Specific Language I designed, similar to SQL syntax. It's made using Python, TKinter, and the ICS library.
