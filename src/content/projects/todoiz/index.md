</span>

ToDoiz.io was the first project I worked on when learning full stack development. It is a to do list web application with user authentication, list sharing, sorting, and mobile and desktop views. It uses React, Javascript, and Redux for the frontend, and Google Firebase and Firestore for user authentication and database storage.

## üóíÔ∏è Motivation!

ToDoiz.io was created during my Interaction Design Class at Harvey Mudd College. I really wanted to learn how I could display projects and work on projects I could share with others. Throughout the course I learned Figma, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. Along the way I was learned how to make pull requests, perform code reviews, and learned about databases via Google Firestore's NoSQL db. We even learned design principles by reading the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Don't Make Me Think!

## üóíÔ∏è Results!

<!-- This project was an assignment that each week would be worked on collaboratively and built upon previous work. At the end of the project your partner and you would have a working note taking app of your own creation.

For better and for worse, my partner for this project was incredibly skilled at web development, whereas this was my first time learning it. This meant my partner was doing most of the work on the project while I was stuck trying to learn and adjust to frontend development. 

I could have been okay with that and just left the project to someone else to complete and submit a exceptional project completed while I was learning everything that went into it, but I could tell this was something I was incredibly passionate about. I contacted my professor, my partner, and decided to work on this project alone. This effectively meant giving up a month head start, on a project meant for two people, being done by one person, who has never had experience in frontend development before. -->

While there is much about this project that I am unsatisfied with, and lots that I would change, there is something really important to me about this being my first web application. It is something worked on entirely by myself, so the layout of the app, the options for sorting, what features to add, and the colors present are all decisions made by myself. I originally set out to learn how my projects and work can live outside of the classroom, and in doing so I learned how to take ownership of projects I create and am passionate about.
