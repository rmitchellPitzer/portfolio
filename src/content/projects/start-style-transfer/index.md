During the pandemic I took [CS35: Computing for Insight](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/cs35/) with Professor Dodds. The course investigates how various Python libraries can be used across different disciplines, with the goal to transfer this knowledge to non-CS courses. Some of these libraries include Beautiful Soup, Pandas, OpenCV, NLTK, and TensorFlow. Start Style Transfer is my final project for this class and teaches people with zero experience in CS or Machine Learning how to write Python code in Jupyter Notebooks to perform Style Transfers onto images!

## üêç Motivation

During the pandemic we were all taking CS courses online and I missed being on campus with friends, professors and other students. I thought being able to transfer the style of some campuses and buildings could be a fun way to help alleviate that. I created a Jupyter Notebook that takes in images students uploaded and output that same image with the style of a building on campus applied to it using TensorFlow. This included the McGregor Computer Science Center, dining halls from campuses, and dorms from the campuses. 

This project is also special to me because it was the first big project for CS that I worked on. I could share it with others and show them what I was doing at Harvey Mudd College. This project is special to me because it has a positive impact for beginners in CS as anyone could use it, and it also sparked my interest in UI/UX design! 

## üêç View The Project

I am not sure if the project can still be run as it is not being maintained and Python libraries can become deprecated, but if you would like to view the code you can visit the [repository here!](https://github.com/rmitchellPitzer/StartStyleTransfer)

Thank you so much!
