</span>

During my statistics course at Pitzer College I worked on a poster for social justice issue using one or two tailed t-tests.
I wanted to compare the sentiment, or how positive or negative text is, of fake and real news from a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) containing the two. I used Jupyter notebook and Python NLTK to compare the sentiment, Pandas to process the Kaggle dataset, and seaborn to visualize the differences between fake and real news. I found that fake news was more likely to contain a negative sentiment compared to real news!
